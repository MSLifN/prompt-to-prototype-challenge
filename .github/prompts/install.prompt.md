# Install Dependencies

Install all npm dependencies for this project.

Run the command:
```bash
npm install
```

After installation:
1. Confirm all packages installed successfully
2. Show me the summary of installed packages
3. Let me know if there were any warnings or errors
4. Suggest running `/start` to launch the dev server

If there are any errors, help me troubleshoot them.
