# MVP Kickoff

You're helping build a one-hour MVP using React + Vite. Follow this structure:

1. **Confirm the MVP goal** - Ask the user to describe their idea in one sentence
2. **Identify the core action** - What is the ONE thing users will do? (e.g., answer questions, submit a form, filter data)
3. **List what's needed**:
   - What UI components? (form, button, list, results area)
   - What state do we need?
   - Any data (mock or real)?
4. **Propose 3-5 implementation steps**
5. **Ask for confirmation before proceeding**
6. **Create PRD.md** - After user confirms, generate a `PRD.md` file at the workspace root with:
   - MVP Goal (one sentence)
   - Core User Action
   - UI Components needed
   - State requirements
   - Data requirements
   - Implementation steps (numbered list)
   - Success criteria (what "done" looks like)

Keep scope minimal. No heavy frameworks unless explicitly requested.
