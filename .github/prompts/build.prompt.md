# Build MVP

Implement the MVP plan from PRD.md.

Steps:
1. Read PRD.md to understand the requirements
2. Check existing workspace structure
3. Follow the implementation steps in order
4. Write clean, minimal code in src/App.jsx
5. Run `npm run dev` to test
6. Verify everything works with no console errors

Keep code simple:
- Everything in App.jsx unless there's a clear reason to split
- Use useState for state management
- No additional dependencies unless necessary
- Inline styles or style objects for simplicity
