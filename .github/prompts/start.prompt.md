# Start Dev Server

Start the Vite development server for this React app.

Run the command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

After starting:
1. Wait for the server to start successfully
2. Look for the local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`)
3. Tell me the URL so I can open it in my browser
4. Let me know the server is ready to use

If there are any errors:
- Check if dependencies are installed (`npm install` if needed)
- Look for port conflicts
- Show me the error message so we can fix it
