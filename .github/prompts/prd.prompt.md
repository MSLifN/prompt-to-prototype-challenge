# Create PRD

Help me plan my one-hour MVP and create a Product Requirements Document.

Follow these steps:
1. Confirm the MVP goal in one sentence
2. Identify the ONE core user action
3. Break down UI components, state, and data requirements
4. Propose 3-5 clear implementation steps
5. Get my confirmation
6. Create a PRD.md file at the workspace root

Keep scope minimal and validate the MVP is achievable in ~1 hour.
