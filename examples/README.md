# Free Tier Examples

This folder contains example MVPs built using the **free tier workflow**.

Each example includes:
- A PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- The source code implementing the MVP
- Notes on the build process

## Examples

### 1. Speed Math Quiz (`PRD-speed-math-quiz.md`)

A simple quiz app that demonstrates:
- Using Copilot Chat to generate initial structure
- Using Inline Chat to add functionality
- State management with React hooks
- Clean, minimal styling

**Time to build:** ~30-45 minutes

## Using These Examples

1. **Read the PRD** to understand the scope and features
2. **Try building it yourself** following the free tier workflow guide
3. **Compare** your implementation with the example
4. **Learn** from the prompts and patterns used
