# Option A: Code a Web Page

Build your prototype as a **single HTML file** with embedded CSS and JavaScript. No build tools, no terminal, no npm required.

## ✅ What You'll Create

A working web page that brings your idea to life, using the PRD and branding you created in earlier steps.

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- Anyone who wants to build their own idea
- Great for pairing and co-creation
- Works with screen readers and zoom
- No prior coding experience required (Copilot helps!)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Open in VS Code

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to **File > Open Folder** and select the `templates/option-a` folder
3. Open `index.html`

### Step 2: Open Copilot Chat

Click the chat icon in the sidebar, or press `Ctrl+Alt+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Alt+I` (Mac)

### Step 3: Integrate Your PRD

Copy your PRD into the chat and ask:

```
Based on this PRD, update the index.html to create the main UI for my prototype:

[Paste your PRD here]
```

### Step 4: Apply Your Branding

```
Apply these brand colors and styling to the page:
- Primary color: [your color]
- Secondary color: [your color]
- Font: [your font choice]
- Update the header with my product name: [name]
- Update the tagline to: [tagline]
```

### Step 5: Build Features

For each feature in your PRD, ask Copilot:

```
Add [feature name] to the page. It should [describe what it does].
```

### Step 6: Preview Your Work

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser:
- **Windows:** Right-click the file > Open with > Chrome/Edge/Firefox
- **Mac:** Right-click > Open With > Safari/Chrome
- **Or:** Drag the file into your browser window
